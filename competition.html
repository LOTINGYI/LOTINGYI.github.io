                    <p>Team up for the NASA Hackathon. We designed "Fire Flighter" solution for the "SPOT THAT FIRE
                        V2.0" challenge. Our work is actually a signed website where we apply azure services, including
                        Azure web app, Cosmos DB, Blob storage, Function app.
                        From this competition, we almost stay up for three days, focus on getting a solution in this
                        shortest time, and we use a lot of Azure services connecting to our website. Therefore, we have
                        the ability to designa and implement a cloud solution.</p>
